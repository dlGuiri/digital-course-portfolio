# School Portfolio
I am Darwin Louis M. Guirigay, a 2nd year at MMCM in the CCIS BS CS course. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about technology and problem-solving, and studying computer science has allowed me to dive into areas like programming, software development, and data structures.

This logo uses the initial letters of our last names to act as the representation of "Guided Lens Robotics" since our project is mainly about analyzing oral images.
